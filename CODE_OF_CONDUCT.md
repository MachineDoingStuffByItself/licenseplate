This repo is still tiny, and putting up a huge formal code of conduct feels misplaced: How could there be a community leader if there's currently just one person hacking ;-)

In either case, I am happy that you are considering contributing. For what regards a code of conduct: Don't be an ***hole. If in doubt, try to be nicer. 

If you feel badly treated by anyone in this repo, or know anyone that feels that way, please contact Michael Weiss immediately. Contact details on [mweiss.ch](https://mweiss.ch).

THANKS! :-)
